# StreakHub ðŸš€

## Introduction
**StreakHub** is a gamified platform designed to help developers maintain consistent coding habits by tracking their GitHub commit streaks. Inspired by the **100 Days of Code challenge** and **Duolingo's streak system**, StreakHub combines motivation, accountability and fun into one seamless experience.

## Features
### Core Features
- **Daily Commit Streak Tracker:** Visualize your progress with streaks like `100/365 ðŸ”¥`.
- **Custom Challenges:** Choose from default challenges (e.g., 100 Days of Code) or create your own (e.g., 30-day, 365-day streaks).
- **Dynamic Widgets:** Add customizable widgets to your GitHub profile to track daily streaks, progress bars and leaderboards.

### Advanced Features
- **Gamification:** Earn badges for milestones and level up based on activity streaks. Includes forgiveness options for valid breaks.
- **Community Integration:** Join public challenges, leaderboards and share progress with peers.
- **Rich Insights:** View detailed coding impact stats, hours spent and repositories contributed to.
- **Accountability Tools:** Receive daily reminders, logs for reflection and goal-setting prompts.

## Why StreakHub?
- **Motivates Consistency:** A Duolingo-style streak system encourages daily coding.
- **Leverages Popular Trends:** Combines GitHub stats with the 100 Days of Code challenge.
- **Builds Community:** Fosters collaboration and friendly competition among developers.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (dashboard and widgets)
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- **APIs:** GitHub API for fetching commit data
