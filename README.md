# StreakHub ðŸš€

## Introduction
**StreakHub** is a gamified platform that helps developers stay consistent with their coding habits. Inspired by the **100 Days of Code challenge** and **Duolingo's streak system**, it combines tracking, accountability, and fun into one experience.

## Features
### Core Features
- **Daily Commit Streak Tracker:**
  - Visualize your progress with streaks like `100/365 ðŸ”¥`:

- **Dynamic Widgets:**
  - Add widgets to your GitHub profile to track:
    - Daily streaks.
    - Progress bars for challenges.
    - Leaderboards for collaborative challenges.

### Advanced Features

  - Built-in forgiveness options to allow for valid breaks without losing streaks.
- **Community Integration:**
