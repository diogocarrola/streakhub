# StreakHub ðŸš€

## Introduction

**StreakHub** is a simple, lightweight tool to help developers mantain consistent coding habits by tracking their GitHub commit streaks. Inspired by the **100 Days of Code** challenge and **Duolingo's streak system**, StreakHub lets you easily generate a streak badge for your GitHub profile.

## Features

- **SVG Streak Widget:** Instantly generate a modern SVG badge showing your daily commit streak (since Jan 1, 2025).
- **No Registration Needed:** Just enter your GitHub username and get your streak badge.
- **Easy Embedding:** Copy a Markdown snippet and add it to your GitHub profile README.
- **Mobile Friendly:** Works on desktop and mobile browsers.

## How to Use

1. **Go to the StreakHub Widget Generator:**  
   [https://diogocarrola.github.io/streakhub/](https://diogocarrola.github.io/streakhub/)
2. **Enter your GitHub username** in the input box.
3. **Preview your streak SVG** and copy the provided Markdown snippet.
4. **Paste the Markdown** into your GitHub profile README:
   ```markdown
   ![StreakHub](https://streakhub.onrender.com/widget/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME)
   ```
5. **Save your README** file. Your streak badge will now be visible on your GitHub profile!
6. **Commit at least once a day** to keep your streak alive! If you miss a day, your streak will reset, but don't worry, you can always start again.
